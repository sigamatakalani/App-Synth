# App-Synth

Team Application Synthesis has been tasked with producing a graph visualization application.
This application reads the graph information from a text-file.
The information from the text-file is then interpreted to construct the relevant objects.
These objects are then graphically represented in a three-dimesional space.
This space is then viewed with a smart-phone device using VR technology.
This space is simultaneously and synchronously viewed on a desktop application environment.
This allows for many users to view what the VR view is displaying.
The graph is to be manipulated using hand gestures, idealy from the smart-phone camera as the source of input.
